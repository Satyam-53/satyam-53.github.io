  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently working as a Member of Technical Staff at <strong>Cohesity</strong> where I build robust distributed systems.  
    My academic journey took me from <strong>BITS Pilani</strong> to a DAAD scholarship in Germany, to a research stint at UC San Diego.  
    I’ll soon be joining the <strong>MS CS program at UW–Madison</strong> to dive deeper into machine learning, perception, and cognition-inspired AI.

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I work at the intersection of intelligence and real-world deployment — from integrating radar sensors in simulators to making AI models more interpretable and human-aligned.

    Occasionally, I write about research, reflections, and sometimes heartbreaks that belong in poetry.
