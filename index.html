  <section>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m currently pursuing my <strong>MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego</strong>, focusing on <strong>machine learning, computer vision, and cognition-inspired AI</strong>.</p>
    <p>
      Previously at <strong>Cohesity</strong>, I built <strong>scalable distributed infrastructure</strong>, implemented <strong>REST APIs</strong>, enhanced <strong>system reliability</strong> through cross-functional collaboration, and developed a <strong>cutting-edge backup adapter</strong> with <strong>CI/CD integration</strong>, achieving high <strong>scalability, resilience, and maintainability</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>My journey has taken me from <strong>BITS Pilani</strong>, to a <strong>DAAD Scholarship</strong> at TU Braunschweig where I developed a multimodal cECG dataset and deep learning reliability model, and to UC San Diego as a <strong>Khorana Scholar</strong> for my <strong>undergraduate thesis</strong>, where I built <strong>C-Shenron</strong>, a realistic radar simulation framework for autonomous driving research.</p>
